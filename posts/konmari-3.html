<p>This is part 3 of my effort to &ldquo;Put my house in order&rdquo; <em>a la</em> <a href="https://amzn.to/2yKsBll"><em>The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up</em></a>. Those readers who know me personally may have realized by now that I'm in the midst of my late-Autumn depressive spiral, and that my tidying efforts are a symptom. Let&rsquo;s talk about why:</p>

<h2 id="insidious-messes">Insidious Messes</h2>

<p>Generally, my cleaning isn&rsquo;t scheduled. I clean whenever I have the time, and try to blast through as much as possible. Inevitably, as things pile up later in the year and I have less and less energy to do them, my living space becomes more cluttered, dusty, and entropic.</p>

<p>At some point, the messiness crosses a threshold, that I'll call the &ldquo;Pennie can&rsquo;t stand this anymore&rdquo; Line. My nose is continuously congested, my throat is dry, I have a cough, and simply <em>looking</em> at any dusty surface in my home makes me panic.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny. The things I do when I'm full of energy in the Spring in Summer set me up to fall hard when the depression comes. Maybe more intelligent habits &amp; planning will help me in the long-term, I think, hence this <em>Konmari</em> attempt. </p>

<h2 id="pagefaults">Pagefaults</h2>

<p>If my place is tidy and organized, it will take less energy to keep that way. If I <em>only</em> have stuff I need, I will have enough physical &ldquo;address space&rdquo; for it. Let&rsquo;s pretend your living space is a computer:</p>

<p>Storage spaces form the SSD. Surfaces and floors are RAM. When you use something, you <em>load it into RAM</em>&mdash;your desk, your kitchen counter, your bathroom counter, etc., and when you're done with it, it goes back to its spot on the hard drive. This is a little unrealistic, since digital files don&rsquo;t have to be &ldquo;put back&rdquo;, but bear with me.</p>

<p>What happens when you leave items &ldquo;in RAM&rdquo;? What if you leave <em>a lot of items</em> in RAM? If you have too much stuff, it won&rsquo;t all <em>fit</em> on the hard drive in a neat structure. So you store it permanently in what is intended to be <em>temporary</em> storage space, such as <em>the floor</em>.</p>

<p>Eventually, you need to load something into RAM, say, a homework assignment, but your RAM is full&mdash;there&rsquo;s stuff all over your desk. So, now what? You need paging memory. So you take some stuff in RAM, which may or may not belong together, and you <em>shove</em> it into storage somewhere. An Amazon box full of Tupperware, Astroglide, and soldering tips, why not?</p>

<p>Over time, your &ldquo;files&rdquo;&mdash;groups of things that belong together, are fragmented. Your desk and counters have become LRU caches&mdash;whatever you used yesterday is right here, but whatever you used before that is <em>who knows where</em> in the pagefile and <em>good luck ever finding it</em>. Additionally, your performace slips, because you never have space in RAM to do anything.</p>

<blockquote><p>You need your stapler? <em>Pagefault.</em> Ok, wait, here it is. Now you need your pencils? <em>Pagefault.</em> Um&hellip; Where the Hell are&mdash;OH! Here they are. Uh&hellip; What were we doing, again? Why did we come in here? We should vacuum. But there&rsquo;s stuff all over your floor&hellip; I know! Let&rsquo;s make mac &lsquo;n&rsquo; cheese.</p></blockquote>

<h2 id="being-an-hsp-normal-reactions-but-extra">Being an HSP: Normal Reactions, But Extra</h2>

<p>My environment has a strong effect on my mind and body. Trapped in an unbearably messy friend&rsquo;s house for the weekend? Dollars to donuts I'll be constipated when I come home. Maybe that&rsquo;s TMI, maybe that&rsquo;s too woo-woo for you. But it&rsquo;s true. And it sucks. </p>

<p>When my own space has fallen to neglect, it&rsquo;s a sign that <em>I've</em> fallen to neglect, too. My mess is a self-portrait, showing everyone my anxiety, forgetfulness, and sense of hopelessness, and it doesn&rsquo;t work like <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em>. Instead, I get my problems back with interest.</p>

<h2 id="college-students-and-cleaning">College Students &amp; Cleaning</h2>

<p>Something I've noticed is true of <em>many</em> anxious college students is that we clean under pressure, as a form of avoidance or procrastination, but also out of a desperate need for order. Exams coming up? Expect floor-scrubbing and a pristine sock drawer.</p>

<p>Why? Because your mind is running on empty batteries. You need order and peace to recharge, but instead, your body is on high-alert and <em>everything</em> is an emergency. Unable to find peace or solace in your head, you naturally seek it externally, but cannot find it, instead finding a pile of laundry on the floor, dust everywhere, and a long list of responsibilities, all falling by the wayside as you spiral.</p>

<p>In the face of overwhelm, you turn to the most manageable tasks you can find, scrambling to feel some <em>progress</em> and <em>order</em>. For many people, the most manageable tasks are housekeeping. Your home, like everything else, has snowballed into something daunting, but if you can <em>just</em> get it clean, then <em>maybe</em> the sanctuary of a clean living space will give you some rest. Maybe, just maybe, doing the dishes will make your term paper less intimidating. Maybe. Hopefully.</p>

<h2 id="konmari-is-overwhelming-too">Konmari is Overwhelming, Too</h2>

<p>Imagine if you had to defragment your old PC&rsquo;s hard drive yourself, manually, by moving boxes around a warehouse. Of course, I don&rsquo;t live in a warehouse and I have comparatively few possessions, but it <em>feels</em> like that.</p>

<p>Facing every possession I have kept buried is difficult. Some items are painful to remember, others are a reminder of my faults or poor judgment. Many things are sentimental. Ironically, it is very difficult to Konmari in a space that hasn&rsquo;t been Konmari'd yet&mdash;there&rsquo;s stuff everywhere. </p>

<p>To go through my clothes, for example, I had to shuffle around lots of other stuff to make room for them. At an emotional baseline, this process wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad, but doing it in the midst of a Bad Time has made it vastly more burdensome.</p>

<p>But I have to finish it.</p>
