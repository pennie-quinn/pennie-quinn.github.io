<div class="inner post-body"><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I suck at taking care of myself and not sucking is really hard. </p>

<p>In Spring of 2017, I was a full-time undergrad student and worked as a software maintenance intern (pooping out ASP pages in VB.NET) at a government office. As is typical of my Winter-Spring experience, I began to rely heavily on Pall Malls and cheap coffee to keep up in spite of depression. Then the coffee became energy drinks <em>and</em> coffee, a few cigs a day became a pack or more, and a late night here or there became 48 hours awake followed by 16 hours asleep.</p>

<p>As things progressed, I continued to deteriorate until:</p>

<ul>
<li>I failed 2 classes, when I had never failed a class in my <em>life</em>.</li>
<li>I lost my <em>job</em> because my sleep schedule was so messed up.</li>
<li>I lost my <em>house</em> because I couldn&rsquo;t pay rent without the job.</li>
<li>I lost my <em>car</em> because my vigilance was non-existent and I got in an accident.</li>
</ul>


<p>This&hellip; Has happened before. This has happened <em>several</em> times. The spiral. Trying to keep up, overextending myself, falling short, compensating with chemicals, accelerating ever more in my descent, until I drop everything, feel suicidal and hopeless, and spend a few months recuperating while couch-surfing and selling my possessions to make my desperate ends meet. Then I piece things back together with hard work and good habits, until it the glue falters again.</p>

<h2>Getting Better</h2>

<p>Obviously, I've tried many remedies. I'm 25 and haven&rsquo;t beaten my most basic demons yet, and it feels pathetic, all the time. As a student, I have access to free therapy and rudimentary healthcare, so in 2018, I finally began therapy, ultimately trying a couple different SSRIs before finding one which <em>seems</em> to help control my depression and anxiety <em>somewhat</em>.</p>

<p>However, I still seem incapable of handling the type and degree of stress (and expected productivity) which most others my age can handle, which is difficult not to moralize as a massive personal failing in willpower, which is not a constructive view of the problem. Yoga helps. Regular exercise helps. A clean diet helps. Building better habits helps. Leaving the house helps. All of these require discipline, which disintegrates under my symptoms. Do I need more of a support system? Am I just not <em>trying</em> hard enough?</p>

<h2>People-Watching</h2>

<p>Observing friends and family who are healthier than myself, asking them occasional questions, and contrasting their good habits with my awful ones, I have tried to find a &ldquo;recipe&rdquo; for a better experience of life. Obviously, some of the people I'm measuring against have access to opportunities, material security, or other resources that I do not, so let&rsquo;s put positive changes requiring those aside for the moment, and focus on what I can do for free (or, more or less &ldquo;for free&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Of course, all of my friends have their own stressors, struggles, and personal demons, but I cannot shake the impression that they handle theirs far better than I handle my own. So, if a little emulation can help me improve, it is worth a shot.</p>

<p>My healthiest and happiest friends, overwhelmingly, exercise every day or every other day, do not consume much (if any) stimulants, eat real food, and sleep a lot. Additionally, those with issues similar to mine, anxiety mainly, universally do <em>strenuous</em> exercise on a regular basis and indulge in creative hobbies, side gigs, or careers. </p>

<h2>Where I Currently Am</h2>

<h3>Exercise</h3>

<p>I use a FitBit and shoot for a minimum of 60 active minutes each day, but all of my intentional exercise (as opposed to the incidental variety, i.e. cleaning or moving furniture) is just walking. On days with poor weather, I use a treadmill on an incline, but still&mdash;it&rsquo;s only walking. The walking has helped me to feel more energized and less stiff, but it has not affected my anxiety much. </p>

<p>My anxious friends who seem to manage their symptoms well <em>all</em> have physically intensive pastimes: running, softball, hiking, etc. When I was at my healthiest and happiest, I was in a marching band, and later, felt almost okay when working underpaid manual labor jobs despite all the stress they brought.</p>

<h3>Stimulants</h3>

<p>I have been attempting to stop smoking, intermittently, for several years now. I am 25 years old and began smoking at 16, so if I don&rsquo;t successfully quit before my birthday, I will have been a smoker for a full <em>decade</em>. That sucks. Over the past year, I have cut down on my nicotine consumption significantly, with vaping becoming my primary method, and working from 24mg fluid to 3mg fluid. That is a lot of progress, owed partly to my SSRI and mostly to the unyielding support of my girlfriend. Accordingly, I did an experiment to see if I could now simply <em>stop</em> without horrible withdrawals, and the answer, quite discouragingly, was <em>no</em>.</p>

<p>My addiction to caffeine (most commonly, coffee) has fluctuated wildly over the time that I have been using it, and presently is somewhere near the middle of my range. With no caffeine, I will be lethargic and brain-fogged all day, to say nothing of the headaches. One cup of coffee gets me to about 2pm, at which point I crash, hard. So most days I have two cups of coffee, occasionally more&hellip; And I still have soda a couple times a week.</p>

<p>I recently learned that nicotine affects the body&rsquo;s ability to metabolize caffeine, effectively halving the caffeine&rsquo;s effects, which explains quite a lot: smoking and vaping less has seemingly worsened my sleep schedule, because I did <em>not</em> consume less caffeine to compensate. In turn, the jittery anxiousness of too much caffeine has led to more sensory overloads and panic attacks, creating a much greater temptation to smoke.</p>

<h3>Diet</h3>

<p>I eat garbage. Just utter garbage. Low-protein, high-carb, nutritionally poor garbage, for two primary reasons: 1) it&rsquo;s cheap as Hell, and 2) I have an unhealthy relationship with food. I enjoy real, healthful foods immensely, but I rarely eat them. My last job paid decently, and while I worked there I ate a lot of salad, Brie, hummus, fruit, and almond milk. Now I mostly eat canned pasta, bologna sandwiches, and dollar store junk food. My digestive health is awful, I have gained a lot of weight, and I feel bloated and stupid every single day, which isn&rsquo;t helped by having sugary coffee and soda on a regular basis.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<h3>Exercise</h3>

<p>I think I will add some weight training to my routine for a few weeks and see if it helps. If it <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> help, I may try jogging instead. Also, I should find some yoga workouts on YouTube to help with my homebody programmer stiffness.</p>

<h3>Stimulants</h3>

<p>It seems that if I am to be successful in quitting nicotine, I must also quit caffeine, as it has become all too easy to overdo it. I also strongly associate coffee and cigarettes, effectively tempting myself every morning at the time when I have the <em>least</em> discipline and foggiest head. It is difficult to &ldquo;wean off&rdquo; a single cup of coffee, and I think it will be easier to quit caffeine cold turkey and take ibuprofen for a couple weeks.</p>

<h3>Diet</h3>

<p>I should quit refined sugars, for the sake of my teeth and general health. Eating a Snickers or something <em>physically hurts</em>, yet I still do it, and I need to stop. I need to shop around and see if I can get some nutritious food cheaply. If I can, I can plan meals around that and avoid bringing junk food home in the first place. If I <em>can&rsquo;t</em>, I can instead try to get used to lots of oatmeal and rice&hellip; I guess.</p>

<h2>Wish Me Luck</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s all I have for today. More exercise, no caffeine, more real food. Hopefully it helps, and if not, I have a brutal-but-hopefully-efficient &ldquo;rehab program&rdquo; outlined for myself at the end of the semester. </p>

<p>Peace and love,
Pennie</p>
