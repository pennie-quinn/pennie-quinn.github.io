<p>Yesterday, I finished applying the Konmari Method to my room and bathroom. This is the <em>first time in my life</em> that I have <em>finished unpacking</em> after a move&mdash;how crazy! I walked into my bedroom to get my keys (from a dish of &ldquo;pocket items&rdquo; in the top drawer of my endtable), as I was about to carry out the last of the night&rsquo;s garbage. </p>

<p>Stepping into my room, seeing it clean and tidy, dust-free, dimly lit, soft bossa nova rippling gently out from my computer, nearly brought me to tears. A huge sigh escaped me, and I felt my entire body &ldquo;let go&rdquo;&mdash;tension I wasn&rsquo;t even aware of was suddenly obvious, even as it left. I later explained to my S.O. that my room felt &ldquo;quieter&rdquo;, and that when I walked into it this time, it felt inviting, as though it were offering me a hug.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t sleep particularly well last night, instead having nightmares and waking up frequently as I often do. I had the &ldquo;teeth falling out&rdquo; nightmare, which particularly gets to me most of the time. But, this morning, although I did wake up late, I felt at ease. </p>

<p>Tired from nightmares, sore from my cleaning marathon, and still: I <em>felt</em> like a morning person today, something that has slipped away in recent months. I got up cheerfully, brushed my hair and teeth, cleaned the litter box, swept, made coffee&mdash;in other words, had the 15-minute morning routine of a functioning adult, for the first time in <strong>ages</strong>. It didn&rsquo;t feel overwhelming. It didn&rsquo;t feel like a Sisyphean task. It was just&hellip; life. Normal life. How wonderful!</p>

<p>All that remains is to ensure that I <em>keep</em> things tidy, which is now made as easy as possible: put things back after use, and spend ~20 minutes on routine, daily cleaning. In what is hopefully the <em>final</em> part of this series, we'll talk about applying Konmari to digital life. </p>

<p>Thanks for reading. :)</p>
