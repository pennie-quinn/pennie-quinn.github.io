<div class="inner post-body"><p>One of my favorite indie games is <a href="https://www.anodynegame.com"><em>Anodyne</em></a>,
a game developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/sean_HTCH">Sean Han Tani 韓谷</a>
and <a href="https://twitter.com/even_kei">Joni Kittaka</a>. 
It is a zelda-like inspired by <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link&rsquo;s Awakening</em>, 
a longtime favorite. The game deals with themes of friendships, emotional labor,
regret, and fugue (that&rsquo;s my interpretation, anyway), while retaining the mechanical 
and exploratory fun of its inspirations.</p>

<p>In spring 2017, I started development on a zelda-like of my own, intended to 
explore depression, trauma, and trans identity. It was written in C, and 
deliberately constructed, both in its source code, art, and mechanics, to evoke 
the carefree innocence of my days playing Gameboy Color outside as a child.</p>

<p>A common mechanic in Zelda games for GBC is &ldquo;corner walking&rdquo;. In the first
<em>Legend of Zelda</em>, Link &ldquo;drifts&rdquo; toward the center of tiles as he walks, to
prevent getting stuck on corners. In <em>A Link to the Past</em>, the physical tile grid
is more granular, with 8px by 8px physics tiles, and right triangle corners,
avoiding the problem entirely.</p>

<p>But on the Gameboy Color, while graphical tiles were still 8px by 8px to suit the 
graphical hardware and rendering pipeline of the system, physical tiles were 
16px by 16px&mdash;the same size, roughly, as Link and other characters. This was due 
to the fact that RAM on the GBC was more highly prized. So, each 16x16 logical 
&ldquo;tile&rdquo; was drawn with four 8x8 graphical characters.</p>

<p>Also, no diagonal tiles were implemented. This presented a problem: with such a 
low resolution for physics information (80 bytes + a border of &ldquo;always solid&rdquo; 
tiles outside the screen boundary), it was very easy for Link to get stuck on 
corners during play. The &ldquo;drifting&rdquo; mechanic of <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> would be 
infeasible, as Link could be drifting much farther; this would be visually 
jarring and make players feel as though they were not in control, as though 
Link were drunk.</p>

<p>So, the solution chosen was this: detect when link is moving toward a <em>corner</em>, 
with only a small overlap on the perpendicular axis, and &ldquo;nudge&rdquo; him around it, 
but only after he was touching the solid tile. Effectively, Link would &ldquo;slide&rdquo; 
or &ldquo;sidle&rdquo; along the wall to get around it. This felt natural during play, and 
was, in my opinion, a good solution.</p>

<p>Given that my game was attempting to evoke the same aesthetic, I wanted to have 
the same behavior. So, my not-very-good physics engine was given corner walk routines. 
However! It was more tricky to implement than I expected (as usual), and while 
I ultimately had a working implementation, it retained some bugs. For example: 
walking face-first into the middle of a long wall would result in the player 
character sliding off the corner of one wall tile into the face of its adjacent 
neighbor.</p>

<p>Looking back, I have several solutions to the problem in mind. That game 
is currently being rewritten in a different language so that porting to various 
platforms will be possible with the amount of time that I have.</p>

<p>Recently, I replayed Anodyne, because it holds a special place in my depressive,
game-loving heart. I was plodding along, doing all the things, luxuriating in the 
excellent soundtrack, when something wholly unexpected happened:</p>

<p>I walked toward a boulder&hellip; and slid toward the middle of its edge. For a 
fleeting moment, it felt as though I had shared a knowing glance with the 
developer. It felt exactly akin to reading a particularly relatable line in a 
novel or poem, or seeing a character in film that somehow reflected your deepest 
nature back at you (I encourage you to go watch Bojack and cry, if you haven&rsquo;t). 
It was a feeling so human, and inexorably tied not to the artwork, nor the 
music, nor the themes of the game itself, but to its physical construction as a 
sculpture of chiseled bytes, to the developmental process of the programmer.</p>

<p>I teared up the same way I would have in the consumption of any deeply relatable 
piece of art, and that experience, valuable and beautiful as it was to me, was 
completely incidental! I imagined <a href="https://twitter.com/sean_HTCH">Sean Han Tani 韓谷</a> 
(who did the programming work) sighing and muttering &ldquo;Fuck it I guess&rdquo; 
while poring over his own corner walking implementation, only for me to later 
get all this mileage out of a behavior that probably frustrated him.</p>
