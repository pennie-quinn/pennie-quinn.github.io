    <h1>I made a Sokoban clone</h1>
    <strong><time>Wed, 24 Jan, 2018</time></strong>
</header>

<p>At the start of 2018 I was sleeping on a friend's couch, waiting until I was
able to move into a new place. It was stressful for everyone. In typical fashion,
I threw myself into a programming project to fight the depression and anxiety.</p>

<p>And it worked this time. I had built up enough of a codebase in <code>toast</code>, a small
collection of C libraries I've been writing for game jam projects, that I could
actually make something, and finish it, in a reasonable amount of time.</p>

<h3>SWIG</h3>

<p>The primary catalyst was finding <a href="http://www.swig.org/">SWIG</a>.
I had looked for a Lua binding
generator on many previous occasions, and each time, I was disappointed to
find utilities written only for C++. A stackoverflow thread led me to
SWIG, which 1) works great for C,  2) can generate bindings for most popular
scripting languages, not just Lua ,and 3) is highly configurable.</p>

<p>In a few hours, SWIG was integrated into my build process and <code>toast</code> was fully
accessible in Lua. There were a couple kinks--SWIG doesn't understand <code>typedefs</code>,
so in the SWIG pass, <code>typedef'd</code> fundamental types are <code>#defined</code> instead.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a lot of my math library stuff is written as functional macros.
Naturally, these don't have enough implicit data for SWIG to figure out bindings
for them. So I wrote a file, just for SWIG, defining C functions to wrap my
macros, which SWIG then wraps to Lua with prettier names. Yes, that is convoluted.
No, it isn't pretty. Example:</p>

<pre><code>double _macro_clamp    (f64 v, f64 a, f64 b)
{
    return clamp(v,a,b);
}
</code></pre>

<h3>A Test Project</h3>

<p>I am primarily a C programmer. I don't have extensive Lua experience, but I like
the language a lot--it is easy to play in. I wanted to build a test project with
<code>toast</code> to help it mature. Real usage finds bugs better than myopic test cases.</p>

<p>With Lua integration in place, I could quickly poop out whatever I chose, so I
chose Sokoban. As a kid I played a Mac OS 9 clone of the game called
"Sloppy Sokoban" and enjoyed it a lot. Sokoban is a simple game, with simple
rules, so it was a good fit for testing.</p>

<h3>Beginnings</h3>

<p>I wrote sokoban.cpp, which contained all the init, input bindings, and frame timing.
It calls 3 Lua hooks, <code>_init()</code>, <code>_update()</code>, and <code>_render()</code> as needed. Literally
every other bit of the game is written in Lua (I got carried away with the convenience).</p>

<h3>Parsing Levels</h3>

<p>I took some of my old pixel art, from a prototype 2D platformer about ducks,
and a font from another unfinished project, this one a shmup <em>a la</em>
<a href="https://www.ambrosiasw.com/games/dr/">Deimos Rising</a>,
and set to work to get something on the screen.</p>

<p>While researching Sokoban, I discovered that the cult classic had spawned a
still-thriving online community of clones, levels, solution videos, etc. There
is a semi-standard format for sokoban levels, which takes 2 forms: a block of
ASCII characters, or a somewhat-compressed block of ASCII characters. You can
read about the format <a href="http://sokobano.de/wiki/index.php?title=Level_format">here.</a></p>

<p>I also found repositories of level collections, with levels from the original
games in addition to thousands of player-created ones. I nabbed a few levels to
test with, and started writing my parser.</p>

<p>It is at this point that I learned something important: parsing a text file,
character by character, sucks in Lua. Also, spaces are a token in the Sokoban
level format (sigh).</p>

<p>In Lua, the only way to get a character from a string is as a <em>substring</em>,
and the only way to compare <code>char</code> values is by calling <code>string.byte(str, i,j)</code>.
Eesh. Could I have written the parser in C, letting SWIG bind it? Yes. But I
wanted to try doing it "the Lua way", and never changed it thereafter because it
worked fine.</p>

<p>Loaded boards were left as a table of 1-character strings, rather than making
a "tile" structure with more data.</p>

<h3>Better Artwork</h3>

<p>At this point, I decided I didn't want all my walls and boxes (bread) to look
the same, so I made some variants in Aseprite. To apply them, I didn't want to
add data to the level files, nor did I want to add a lot of data to loaded levels.</p>

<p>So, each level string is hashed naively, and its hash is used to seed Lua's RNG.
Then, to draw the board, the seed is reapplied each frame, and the renderer
chooses a random variant from the list for each tile, thus keeping them identical
between renders.</p>

<p>A problem arose: now each piece of bread needs to remember which graphic it uses.
Bread can be moved, meaning it will receive a different graphic from the RNG when
pushed. So loaded levels then had data added for each bread's identity.</p>

<h3>Mechanics</h3>

<p>Implementing the actual rules of Sokoban was a breeze, since it is basically a
board game.</p>

<h3>Animation</h3>

<p>Early on, I used coroutines to make tweens. In the end, most of the animation
in the game was simple enough, with little enough state, that I simply wrote the
code inline.</p>

<p>So, amusingly, player movement uses coroutine tweening, while the new highscore
cutscene with particle systems does <em>not</em>.</p>

<h3>Managing Screens</h3>

<p>About halfway through the project, I realized that the game had become too complex
for me to manage everything with a long chain of <code>if</code>s in <code>_update()</code> and <code>_render()</code>.</p>

<p>So, I implemented a Lua "class" called Screen, from which each screen in the game
inherits some stub methods and flags. Then, I made a simple stack, which holds
Screens and manages them.</p>

<p>Only the top screen on the stack is updated.</p>

<p>For rendering, screens can be "blocking" or "non-blocking". This was done to
facilitate cutscenes and menus. Each frame, the stack provides a list of screens
to be rendered. The first screen in the list will be the first "blocking" screen
from the top of the stack, followed by any "non-blocking" screens above it.</p>

<p>So, for example, the "new highscore" screen is a cutscene which is drawn over the
"level won" screen.</p>

<h3>Transitions</h3>

<p>There is one transition Screen, which is controlled with <code>transition:start(...)</code>.
You specify whether you want to transition 'out' or 'in', and optionally may
provide a callback function to be run when the transition completes. This
method pushes the transition screen onto the screen stack, and pops it automatically
upon completion.</p>

<p>To transition to a new screen looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>transition:start('out', function()
    screen.pop() -- remove the current screen, for example
    screen.push(newscr)
    transition:start('in')
end)
</code></pre>

<h3>Lua Binding Binding Bindings</h3>

<p>C integration is cool, but I ended up writing a lot of repeated code to use
integrated functions and datatypes in Sokoban, with many opportunities for
incorrect usage on my part.</p>

<p>I fixed this problem by abstracting various pieces of <code>toast</code> interface in Lua
in ways specific to the game's needs. A good example of this is in playing sound
effects: I wrote a Lua function to look up a sound effect by name in the game's
table of SFX assets and play it back through <code>toast</code>, supplying default arguments
and whatnot.</p>

<p>This practice turned code like this:</p>

<pre><code>if toast.btn(toast.btn_start).state == toast_ButtonPressed
   or toast.key_GetState(--[[some input I'm trying out]]) == 1  
then
    local u = sfx['foo.wav'].handle
    toast.mix_PlayChunk(toast.SoundMixer, u, 1, 1, 0)
end
</code></pre>

<p>into code like this:</p>

<pre><code>if input.Start() then audio.playSE('foo') end
</code></pre>

<p>With the added benefit of better error-checking, since I only had to type it <em>once</em>
in the wrapper.</p>

<h3>Toast Evolution</h3>

<p>Throughout the course of making my Sokoban clone, I uncovered bugs in <code>toast</code>,
as I had hoped I would. Subimages were pitched wrong. Alpha blend was busted.
Some of my SWIG configuration needed fixing. I found problems like these by
using my own libs intuitively for actual work, with real expectations.</p>

<p>As usual, I should have followed a programming saw more diligently:</p>

<p id="center"> <strong>"Always write the usage code first!"</strong> </p>

<p>I also took some breaks from Sokoban to write new utilities: <code>paq_aseprite.h</code>,
an <code>stb_image</code>-style library for loading Aseprite project files directly,
and <code>paq_wav.h</code>, a naive .WAV file loader (16bit PCM WAVs only, for the moment).</p>

<p>My Aseprite decoder isn't used in Sokoban, but I had wanted something like it
on numerous previous projects, and I knew I would want something like it again
on upcoming ones.</p>

<p>My WAV loader is used for all the SFX, and was written out of frustration.
I previously used only <code>stb_vorbis</code> to load my audio, meaning that any
audio I wanted to use needed to be an .ogg file... Meaning that to even <em>test</em>
a sound effect, I first needed to convert it from a .wav to an .ogg. Loading a WAV
file in the most trivial case (which I could assure for myself) is pretty
straightforward, so I spent a couple of hours adding it in.</p>

<p>I also made a little .NET program to conveniently browse and copy/rename .wav files,
which proved to be a lifesaver when sifting through SFX libraries.</p>

<h3>The Future of Toast</h3>

<p>Building an actual game with <code>toast</code> helped me fix some of its bugs, but it also
made me realize that a <em>lot</em> of its libraries aren't very user-friendly, despite
my best efforts. They also contain inconsistencies and other issues.</p>

<p>So, before <code>toast</code> ever sees the light of day I intend to rework most of it into
something more palatable. I will likely remove "convenient" dependences between
modules, for example, to make each one <em>actually</em> be self-contained. I will likely
turn most <code>toast</code> modules into <code>paq_*.h</code> libraries, which will be able to stand alone.</p>
