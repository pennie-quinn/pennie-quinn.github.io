Whoopie do, I made another static site generator for personal use, this time in `Python` because "why not?"
Doing it with `Python` was a lot less time-consuming than the mess I wrote in `C` previously, and in `bash` before that.

Maybe I'll actually use this blog (*HA*). But seriously maybe I will. *Who knows?*
